#PQ60-Template
A template board and schematic in Eagle 7.2 for the Pocket Qube 60 standard.

**Untested**

A very simple template in Eagle 7.2 which has the connectors in the right places, with the right net names and the right connections made.

Please note that the locating pegs for the top and bottom PQ60 connectors are 0.3mm out, this is due to different offsets in the Hirose datasheet, 1.5mm and 1.8mm respectively.
